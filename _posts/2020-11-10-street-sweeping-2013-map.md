Street sweeping schedule by Ward and Ward sections number. To find your Ward section, visit http://bit.ly/Hz0aCo. For more information about the City's Street Sweeping program, go to http://bit.ly/H2PHUP. The data can be viewed on the Chicago Data Portal with a web browser. However, to view or use the files outside of a web browser, you will need to use compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS (shapefile) or Google Earth (KML or KMZ), is required.
