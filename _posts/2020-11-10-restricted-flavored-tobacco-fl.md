A list of tobacco flavor terms. These terms may be considered, along with other evidence, to determine if a tobacco product is flavored. See http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/policy_planning/Board_of_Health/FlavoredTobaccoRules_Final_Dec112015.pdf for the specifics of the regulation regarding restrictions on the sale of flavored tobacco products within 500 feet of schools. A non-exhaustive list of restricted flavored tobacco products is available here: https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/5wce-bks2.
