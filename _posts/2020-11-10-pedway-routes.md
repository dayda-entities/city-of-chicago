Pedway routes in Chicago. Chicagoâ€™s downtown pedestrian way system, the Pedway, lies in the heart of the city. This system of underground tunnels and overhead bridges links more than 40 blocks in the Central Business District, covering roughly five miles.. To view or use these files outside of a web brower, compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS, is required.
