List of free flu clinics offered throughout Chicago, either by the Department of Public Health or in collaboration with it.

Unlike older versions of the flu shot datasets, this one combines multiple years and will grow over the years. Seasons are now identified by the years they span (e.g., 2018-2019) instead of the year in which they begin (e.g., 2018).

Each season has a filtered view showing only records from that season. These filtered views can be used for almost all purposes as if they were datasets.

This dataset approximately follows https://github.com/codeforamerica/flu-shot-spec/blob/master/data-format.csv and is designed for use by https://github.com/tkompare/chicagoflushots.
