The website availability metrics below are derived from an automated monitor that sends a request every two minutes to each website. The website is considered unavailable if the response to any request takes longer than a pre-defined wait time. The monitors run continuously and are not normally disabled during scheduled maintenance or downtime, so the reported metrics incorporate both planned and unplanned downtime.
