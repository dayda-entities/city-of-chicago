As described in http://bit.ly/311HistoricalPost, the function of this dataset was replaced by https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/v6vf-nfxy. This dataset is historical-only.

This dataset contains all open 311 reports of one or more lights out on a wooden pole in the alley and all completed requests since January 1, 2011.  If two requests regarding the same address are made within 30 calendar days of each other, the newest CSR is automatically given the status of “Duplicate (Open)”.   Once the alley light is repaired, the CSR status will read “Completed” for the original request and “Duplicate (Closed)” for any duplicate requests. Data is updated daily.
