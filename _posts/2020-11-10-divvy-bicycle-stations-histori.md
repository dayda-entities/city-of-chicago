Historical availability of bicycles and docks to return bicycles at the Divvy stations (http://divvybikes.com/).  For the current list of stations, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/bbyy-e7gq For real-time status of stations in machine-readable format, see https://feeds.divvybikes.com/stations/stations.json.

Due to a change in the data source, discussed at http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2019/07/10/divvy-datasets-frozen.html, records between 7/7/2019 and 12/9/2019 are missing.
