As part of the preparation process for the 2020 City of Chicago budget, the City conducted a public survey. The final results are shown in this dataset.

For the $1000 Assignment columns, negative values have been converted to blanks and totals above $1000 (after converting negatives to blanks) have been converted to $1000, with all of the component values adjusted accordingly, to retain their relative proportions. Totals below $1000 were not adjusted up because the survey specifically allowed for not allocating the full amount.

For more information on the 2020 budget, including the survey, please see https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/obm/supp_info/budgetdocuments/2020_Budget.html.
