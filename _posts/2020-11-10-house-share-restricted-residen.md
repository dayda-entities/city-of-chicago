The Chicago City Code, Chapter 4-17, allows for shared housing rentals to be prohibited or restricted in specified precincts.  This dataset shows those precincts for which such restrictions have been requested by voter petition, including those approved by ordinance and potentially those for which an attempted repeal of the prohibition is underway or complete.

Current status can be determined from the most recent date.
