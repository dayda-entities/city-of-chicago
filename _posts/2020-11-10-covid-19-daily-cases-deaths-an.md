NOTE, 8/14/2020: This dataset has been modified to include hospitalization columns, in addition to the previously existing case and death columns.

This is the place to look for important information about how to use this dataset, so please expand this box and read on!

This is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html.

For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.

Only Chicago residents are included based on the home ZIP Code, as provided by the medical provider, or the address, as provided by the Cook County Medical Examiner.

Confirmed cases are counted on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths are those occurring among confirmed cases based on the day of death. Hospitalizations are based on the date of first hospitalization. Only one hospitalization is counted for each case. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers and is not verified by CDPH.

Because of the nature of data reporting to CDPH, hospitalizations will be blank for recent dates They will fill in on later updates when the data are received, although, as for cases and deaths, may continue to be updated as further data are received. 

All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects data currently known to CDPH.

Numbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to definitions of COVID-19-related cases and deaths, sources used, how cases and deaths are associated to a specific date, and similar factors.
