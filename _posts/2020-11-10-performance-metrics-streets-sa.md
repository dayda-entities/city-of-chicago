The City of Chicago provides heavy-duty plastic 96-gallon garbage carts to single-family residences and apartment buildings of four units or less. This metric tracks the average number of days the Department of Streets and Sanitation (DSS) takes to complete new garbage cart requests per week. Median days to complete requests as well as total number of requests fulfilled per week are available by mousing over columns. Currently the performance target for completing a new garbage cart request is 7 days. For more information on garbage cart requests, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/9ksk-na4q
