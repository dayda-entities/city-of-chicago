The Chicago Public Library offers one-hour computer sessions and 15-minute computer sessions. Chicago Public Library consists of the Harold Washington Library Center, Sulzer and Woodson regional libraries and over 70 neighborhood branches. Many locations experience sporadic closures to perform facilities upgrade or emergency closures due to heating or air conditioning issues, or area power outages. Independence Branch closed due to a fire in 2015. Whitney Young has been closed since November 2017 for major renovations. Woodson Regional Library reopened after a major renovation in February 2018.
