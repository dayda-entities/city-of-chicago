Due to vehicular accidents, theft and normal wear and tear, City stop signs occasionally need to be replaced or repaired.  The Department of Transportation (CDOT) responds to damaged or missing stop signs reported through 311â€™s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system on a case-by-case basis.  Total number of requests fulfilled per week is also available by mousing over columns.  Due to the public safety importance of stop signs, the target time to respond to stop sign requests is within 1 day.  To report a missing or damaged stop sign, call 311 or see http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/signs_and_pavementmarkings/svcs/stop_sign.html
