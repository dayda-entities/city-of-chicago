This dataset contains performance metrics tracked by the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT). Thirty-five different performance metrics are tracked in this dataset, which reports the performance target, actual performance, and number of requests completed for a given metric. These metrics are based on data calculated from the city's 311 system. Individual breakout of each performance metric are also available under the "More Views" button.
