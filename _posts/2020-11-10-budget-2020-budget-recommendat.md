The dataset details 2020 Budget Recommendations, which is the line-item budget document proposed by the Mayor to the City Council for approval. Budgeted expenditures are identified by department, appropriation account, and funding type: Local, Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG), and other Grants. “Local” funds refer to those line items that are balanced with locally-generated revenue sources, including but not limited to the Corporate Fund, Water Fund, Midway and O’Hare Airport funds, Vehicle Tax Fund, Library Fund and General Obligation Bond funds.

This dataset follows the format of the equivalent datasets from past years except that Appropriation Authority and Appropriation Account have changed from Number to Text in order to accommodate non-numeric values.
