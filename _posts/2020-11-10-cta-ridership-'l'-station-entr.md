This dataset lists monthly station entry averages, by day type (Weekday, Saturday or Sunday/Holiday), as well as monthly totals, beginning in 2001. Note that some stations (such as on the Cermak Branch--now Pink Line) and Skokie did not have Saturday and/or Sunday/holiday service until more recent years, although, in cases where weekday service ran past midnight, late evening fares may appear as part of Saturday tallies.
