All trips, starting November 2018, reported by Transportation Network Providers (sometimes called rideshare companies) to the City of Chicago as part of routine reporting required by ordinance.

Census Tracts are suppressed in some cases, and times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes. Fares are rounded to the nearest $2.50 and tips are rounded to the nearest $1.00.
