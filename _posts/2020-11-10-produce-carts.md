Neighbor Capital is a social enterprise that runs a produce cart program that employs difficult to employ people who manage and operate a cart on a public sidewalk or private plaza across the city. The City of Chicago legalized this business model in 2012 with the requirement that half be set up in low-food access areas. Each cart carries a full line of fresh locally grown produce on an 8 feet by 6 foot stand generally between early morning and early evening hours.
