This metric tracks workforce employment services including basic services, skills training and job placement per month. DFSS provides workforce development services to low income adults, dislocated workers and ex-offenders. These services include job readiness training, vocational training, job placement, supportive services and post-placement retention services.
The Chicago-Cook Workforce Partnership, a newly created agency designed to reform and revitalize workforce development in the greater Chicagoland area, took over operation of DFSSâ€™s Workforce Investment Act funding and delegate agency contracts on July 1, 2012.  http://www.workforceboard.org
