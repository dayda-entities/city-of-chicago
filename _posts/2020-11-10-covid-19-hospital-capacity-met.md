For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.

All Chicago area (EMS Region XI) hospitals (n=27) are required to report bed and ventilator capacity, availability, and occupancy to the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) daily.

Hospitals began reporting ICU surge capacity as part of total capacity on 5/18/2020.

Acute non-ICU bed counts include burn unit, emergency department, medical/surgery (ward), other, pediatrics (pediatric ward) and psychiatry beds.
