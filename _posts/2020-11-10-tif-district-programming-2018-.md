This dataset contains amounts shown in the TIF District Programming 2018-2022 reports as well as from 2023 through the planned expiration of each TIF district. The report and corresponding dataset show estimated fund and project balances through the end of FY 2017. Amounts shown in columns 2018 and later reflect known obligations and proposed projects as well as estimates of revenue based on the current equalized assessed value data for each TIF district produced by the Cook County Clerk.

Versions of this dataset are produced periodically for the then-relevant time periods, which will partially overlap, with newer versions having updated numbers. The immediately previous and next (if available) datasets are shown in the Featured Content cards for this dataset. All versions of this dataset can be found at https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?tags=tif+district+programming.
