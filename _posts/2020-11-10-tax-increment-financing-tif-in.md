TIF Investment Committee (TIC) data includes all projects reviewed by the TIF Investment Committee, since May, 2019. This includes all requests for TIF funding, including TIF-funded public infrastructure projects from the City departments and Sister Agencies, as well as private-sector housing and economic development projects. TIF is a special funding tool used by the City of Chicago to promote public and private investment across the city. Projects must be located on parcels within an active TIF district to be eligible.
