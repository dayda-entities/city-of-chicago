OUTDATED. See the current data at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/htai-wnw4 -- List of alderman, office address, phone number, and website for all 50 Chicago wards.  This version of the data was posted 7/2/2013 and stayed live until 7/16/2015, when it was replaced with the list of aldermen inaugurated 5/18/2015, after allowing time for most office space arrangements to be finalized.
