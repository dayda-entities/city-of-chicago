OUTDATED. See the current data at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/64xf-pyvh -- The Illinois Enterprise Zone Program is designed to stimulate economic growth and neighborhood revitalization in economically depressed areas of the state. For more information about this program, go to http://www.commerce.state.il.us/dceo/Bureaus/Business_Development/Tax+Assistance/Enterprise-Zone.htm.  The data can be viewed on the Chicago Data Portal with a web browser. However, to view or use the files outside of a web browser, you will need to use compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS (shapefile) or Google Earth (KML or KMZ).
