Environmental complaints received by the Department of Environment (DOE) from January 1993 to December 31, 2011 and by the Department of Public Health (CDPH) since January 1, 2012. On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH.   
Data fields requiring description are detailed below. 
COMPLAINT ID:  This is the unique identifier of the complaint incident. 
COMPLAINT TYPE: Specifies the type of complaint. CDPH complaint types are  “Abandoned Site”, “Air Pollution Work Order”, “Asbestos Work Order”, “Construction and Demolition”, “Toxics Hazardous Materials Work Order”, ”Illegal Dumping Work Order”, “Noise Complaint”, “Permits Issued by DOE Work Order”, “Recycling Work Order”, “Service Stations/Storage Tanks Work Order”, “Vehicle Idling Work Order”, and “Water Pollution.” For consistency, historic DOE complaint types were renamed to match the most appropriate CDPH complaint type. DOE complaint types that had no matches are designated as “Other.”  
MAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. 
 INSPECTOR: Contains the badge or ID number of the inspector or engineer who conducted the compliant inspection. 
COMPLAINT DATE: Date complaint was received by the department. 
COMPLAINT DETAIL: Brief description of the nature of the complaint.  
INSPECTION LOG: This is the inspector’s narrative log of the complaint inspection.
DATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.
