This dataset is historical-only. -- Results from a 2017-2018 project of City-installed sensors measuring water runoff from streets and sidewalks. These data can be used to measure the impact of sustainable green infrastructure on flooding. These sensors also captured weather data.

Each row corresponds to a sensor measurement at a specific time and location. Each row is a different sensor, which can be determined from the "Measurement Title" column. The value for each measurement is always numeric and available in the "Measurement Value" column. The corresponding unit of measurement is in the "Units" column. Data may be missing at times due to sensors not being available.
