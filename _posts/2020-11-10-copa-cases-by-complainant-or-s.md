Complaints received by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability and its predecessor agency.

A case will generate multiple rows, sharing the same LOG_NO if there are multiple complainants or subjects. Each row in this dataset is a complainant or subject in a specific case.

Other than identifying the Log Number associated with an investigation being conducted by the Bureau of Internal Affairs section of the Chicago Police Department, information regarding such investigations is not included in this data set.
