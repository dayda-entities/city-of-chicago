Cooling Centers offer residents air-conditioned refuge from oppressive summer heat. The Chicago Department of Family and Support Services operates Cooling 
Centers during the summer months.  Additional facilities are opened as needed in 
mobile buses, libraries, Park District buildings, senior centers, and other community venues.

Some types of facilities are activated only during periods of extreme heat or when conditions warrant. You may call 311 to confirm the currently operating cooling centers or go to http://bit.ly/kIhHPj for more information.
