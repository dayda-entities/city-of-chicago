Each unique combination of a lobbyist, his/her employer, and a client of that employer.  This dataset can be used to see relationships between these three entities.  Each has a separate dataset with more detailed information about each lobbyist, employer, or client. See http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/ethics/provdrs/lobby.html for more information on the Board of Ethics' role in regulating and reporting on lobbying in Chicago.
