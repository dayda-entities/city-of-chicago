Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, Large Project data includes all projects that have received a final grant payment. Large Projects have grants over $250,000 and are required to obtain City Council approval, as well as have a full Redevelopment Agreement governing the terms of the grant. The Neighborhood Opportunity Fund (“NOF”) receives funds from downtown development in order to support the growth and creation of inclusively vibrant commercial corridors in Chicago’s underserved neighborhoods. Business and property owners may apply for grant funding that will pay for the development or rehabilitation of real estate and projects that support new or expanding businesses or cultural assets.
