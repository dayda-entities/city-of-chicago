Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, Small Project data includes all projects that have received a final grant payment. Small Projects may have grants up to $250,000 and must be located in an Eligible Commercial Corridor. The Neighborhood Opportunity Fund (“NOF”) receives funds from downtown development in order to support the growth and creation of inclusively vibrant commercial corridors in Chicago’s underserved neighborhoods. Business and property owners may apply for grant funding that will pay for the development or rehabilitation of real estate and projects that support new or expanding businesses or cultural assets.
