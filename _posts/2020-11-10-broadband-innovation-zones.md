The Broadband Innovation Zones are commercial and industrial corridors the City of Chicago has initially targeted for the private provision of gigabit or near-gigabit broadband speeds for businesses, universities and schools, hospitals, research institutions, and other community organizations. The goal of this initiative is to foster innovation, drive job creation, and stimulate economic growth through the provision of ultra-high-speed internet service at prices substantially below current market rates. To achieve this goal, the City has solicited proposals from qualified vendors to provide these services.
