As described in http://bit.ly/311HistoricalPost, the function of this dataset was replaced by https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/v6vf-nfxy. This dataset is historical-only.

All open sanitation code complaints made to 311 and all requests completed since January 1, 2011. The Department of Streets and Sanitation investigates and remedies reported violations of Chicago’s sanitation code. Residents may request service for violations such as overflowing dumpsters and garbage in the alley.
311 sometimes receives duplicate sanitation code complaints. Requests that have been labeled as duplicates are in the same geographic area as a previous request and have been entered into 311’s Customer Service Request (CSR) system at around the same time. Duplicate complaints are labeled as such in the status field, as either "Open - Dup" or "Completed - Dup."
