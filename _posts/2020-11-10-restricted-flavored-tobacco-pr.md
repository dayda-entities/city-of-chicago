A list of flavored tobacco products that may not be sold within 500 feet of a school in Chicago. See http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/policy_planning/Board_of_Health/FlavoredTobaccoRules_Final_Dec112015.pdf for the specifics of the regulation. This list will be updated periodically. A list of tobacco flavor terms that may be used to determine if a product is flavored is available at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/fkci-tsq8.
