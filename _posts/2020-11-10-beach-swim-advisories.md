This dataset is historical-only. A similar dataset starting in 2017 can be found at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xvsz-3xcj -- The Chicago Park District issues swim advisories at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront based on predicted E. coli levels.  This dataset shows the predictions and whether a swim advisory was issued due to the predicted E. coli level being at least 235 Colony Forming Units (CFU) per 100 ml of water.

The data used to make the predictions can be found in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku and https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75. The measured E. coli levels determined later can be found in https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/2ivx-z93u.
