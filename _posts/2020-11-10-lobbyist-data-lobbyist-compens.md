OUTDATED. See similar current data at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/dw2f-w78u --The lobbyist compensation report is part of the Lobbyist Activity Report, a notarized disclosure that must be filed twice each year (January 20th and July 20th). Lobbyists must report compensation any lobbying-related compensation received during each reporting period from a particular client, rounded to the nearest $1,000 on Form C Part 3 Section G (http://bit.ly/q2lRTh). Lobbyist activity reports are submitted to the Board of Ethics in paper form and are available in their entirety in the Board's offices. The Board has, since 2000, compiled and posted static lists of all lobbyists and their clients online. Previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings.
