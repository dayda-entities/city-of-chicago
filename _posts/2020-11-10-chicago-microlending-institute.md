To improve access to capital, the City of Chicago seeded a $2MM revolving loan fund and partnered with Accion to create the Chicago Microlending Institute (CMI). There is a full list of loans in the https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/dpkg-upyz dataset.  Certain data elements could not be included for privacy reasons but are summarized in this dataset.  Loans without a date are not included in the summary.
