Patrons may place holds on desired materials either online or by contacting any CPL location. Chicago Public Library consists of the Harold Washington Library Center, Sulzer, Legler and Woodson regional libraries and over 70 neighborhood branches. Many locations experience sporadic closures to perform facilities upgrade or emergency closures due to heating or air conditioning issues, or area power outages. Independence, Little Italy (formerly Roosevelt) and Northtown reopened in early 2019 in new locations. The library also opened its 81st location, West Loop, in January. Douglass and Jefferson Park were closed for extensive renovations for most of the year. Legler, South Shore and Merlo were also closed for extensive renovations and will remain closed until 2020. In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Chicago Public Library closed facilities to the public March 21, 2020 â€“ June 7, 2020.
