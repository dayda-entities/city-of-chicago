OUTDATED. This dataset will not be updated further due to changes in how the source data are maintained. For more information on the City’s life safety ordinance, see https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/bldgs/provdrs/inspect/svcs/life_safety_high-riseordinance.html and the contact information on that page. --  This dataset is a listing of the report status of all residential buildings required to submit a Life Safety Evaluation under city ordinance. Because the Chicago building code has since 1975 required new high-rise residential buildings to be constructed with sprinkler systems, the Life Safety Ordinance mostly impacted high-rise residential buildings constructed prior to 1975.  This dataset does not describe the overall safety of a building, only whether or not the life safety evaluation was submitted and approved by the City of Chicago. Please note that the majority of reports “failed” initially as a result of a new reporting process and changes to building standards.
