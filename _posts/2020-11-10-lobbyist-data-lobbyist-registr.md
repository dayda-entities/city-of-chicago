OUTDATED. See similar current data at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/tq3e-t5yq -- All lobbyist registration filings submitted to the Board of Ethics beginning with the 2012 reporting period. / All lobbyists must register with the City of Chicago Board of Ethics by filing a Statement of Registration within five business days of engaging in lobbying activity and annually thereafter by January 20th. Lobbyist registration information is submitted to the Board of Ethics in paper form and is available in its entirety in the Board's offices. The Board has, since 2000, compiled and posted static lists of all lobbyists and their clients online. Previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings. From this point forward, the Board of Ethics will electronically compile more data about lobbyists and their activities and automatically report this information online.
