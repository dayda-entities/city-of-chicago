The following dataset includes "Active Benchmarks," which are provided to facilitate the identification of City-managed standard benchmarks. Standard benchmarks are for public and private use in establishing a point in space. Note: The benchmarks are referenced to the Chicago City Datum = 0.00, (CCD = 579.88 feet above mean tide New York). The City of Chicago Department of Water Managementâ€™s (DWM) Topographic Benchmark is the source of the benchmark information contained in this online database. The information contained in the index card system was compiled by scanning the original cards, then transcribing some of this information to prepare a table and map. Over time, the DWM will contract services to field verify the data and update the index card system and this online database.This dataset was last updated September 2011. Coordinates are estimated. To view map, go to https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Elevation-Benchmarks-Map/kmt9-pg57 or for PDF map, go to http://cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/water/supp_info/Benchmarks/BMMap.pdf.
