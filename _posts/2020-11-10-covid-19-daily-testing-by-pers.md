This is the place to look for important information about how to use this dataset, so please expand this box and read on!

This is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html.

For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.

This dataset contains counts of people tested for COVID-19 and their results. This dataset differs from https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/gkdw-2tgv in that each person is in this dataset only once, even if tested multiple times. In the other dataset, each test is counted, even if multiple tests are performed on the same person, although a person should not appear in that dataset more than once on the same day unless he/she had both a positive and not-positive test.

Only Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider.

Only polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests are included, and only one test is counted for each individual. Tests are counted on the day the specimen was collected. A small number of tests collected prior to 3/1/2020 are not included in the table.

Positive lab results are confirmed for COVID-19. Not-positive lab results include negative results, invalid results, and tests not performed due to improper collection. Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) does not receive all not-positive results.

Demographic data are more complete for those who test positive; care should be taken when calculating percentage positivity among demographic groups.

All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received.
