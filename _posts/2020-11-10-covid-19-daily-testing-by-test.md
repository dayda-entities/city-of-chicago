NOTE: Starting 10/29/2020, this dataset contains demographic breakdowns of tests. It also removes the "Percent Positive Tests" column. This value can be calculated from other columns present. -- This is the place to look for important information about how to use this dataset, so please expand this box and read on!

This is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html.

For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19.

This dataset contains counts of unique tests and results for COVID-19. This dataset differs from https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/t4hh-4ku9 in that each person is in that dataset only once, even if tested multiple times. In this dataset, each test is counted, even if multiple tests are performed on the same person, although a person should not appear in this dataset more than once on the same day unless he/she had both a positive and not-positive test.

The positivity rate displayed in this dataset uses the method most commonly used by other jurisdictions in the United States.

Only Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider.

Only polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests received through electronic lab reporting are included. Individuals may be tested multiple times. Tests are counted on the day the specimen was collected. A small number of tests collected prior to 3/1/2020 are not included in the table.

Positive lab results are confirmed for COVID-19. Not-positive lab results include negative results, invalid results, and tests not performed due to improper collection.

All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received.
