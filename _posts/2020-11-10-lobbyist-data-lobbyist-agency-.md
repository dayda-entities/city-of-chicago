OUTDATED. See similar current data at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/pahz-egmi -- The lobbyist agency report is part of the Lobbyist Activity Report, a notarized disclosure that must be filed twice each year (January 20th and July 20th). Lobbyists must report the name of each City agency lobbied and report whether lobbying involved legislative or administrative action, and give a brief description of the legislative or administrative action promoted or opposed. All lobbyist agency reports are submitted to the Board of Ethics in paper form and are available in their entirety in the Board's offices. The Board has, since 2000, compiled and posted static lists of all lobbyists and their clients online. / Data Owner: Board of Ethics [http://j.mp/mbH9BN] / Time Period: January 1, 2011 to present / Frequency: Data is updated daily  / Related Applications: Registered Lobbyist List [http://bit.ly/FOctNY]
