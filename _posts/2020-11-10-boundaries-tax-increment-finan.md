OUTDATED. See the current data at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/fz5x-7zak -- Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district boundaries in Chicago. The data can be viewed on the Chicago Data Portal with a web browser. However, to view or use the files outside of a web browser, you will need to use compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS (shapefile) or Google Earth (KML or KMZ), is required.
