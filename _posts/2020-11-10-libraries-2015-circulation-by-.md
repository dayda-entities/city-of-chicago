Circulation figures include new checkouts as well as renewals. The Chicago Public Library consists of the Harold Washington Library Center, Sulzer and Woodson regional libraries and over 70 neighborhood branches. Many locations experience sporadic emergency closures due to heating or air conditioning issues, or area power outages.
