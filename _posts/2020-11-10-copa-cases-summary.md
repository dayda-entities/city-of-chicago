Complaints received by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability and its predecessor agency.

Each complaint is represented by a single line. When multiple people are involved, values for each of them are separated by the | character. In all such columns, the people are presented in the same order. For example, the first value in one column corresponds to the same person as the first value in another column.

Other than identifying the Log Number associated with an investigation being conducted by the Bureau of Internal Affairs section of the Chicago Police Department, information regarding such investigations is not included in this data set.
