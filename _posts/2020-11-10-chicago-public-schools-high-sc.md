Attendance boundaries for high schools in the Chicago Public Schools district for school year 2018-2019. Generally, all students in the applicable high school grades who live within one of these boundaries may attend the school. To view or use these shapefiles, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as Google Earth or ArcGIS, are required.
