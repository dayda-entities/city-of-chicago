Blue Cart Residential Recycling zones and schedule. Each recycling zone is divided into two sections â€“ A (Orange) and B (Yellow). Collection is done on an alternating-week basis. For 2012, B/Yellow sections were collected the week of 1/2/2012 and A/Orange sections were collected the week of 1/9/2012, continuing to alternate from there. See http://bit.ly/wssHIB or https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/eb3b-ehmq for the full schedule. For more about Recycling in Chicago, visit http://bit.ly/IcfLHr.
