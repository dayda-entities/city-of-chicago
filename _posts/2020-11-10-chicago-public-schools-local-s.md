Local School Council voting districts for citywide and neighborhood public schools, intended to verify eligibility to run in LSC elections for 2018-2020. The data can be viewed on the Chicago Data Portal with a web browser. However, to view or use the files outside of a web browser, you will need to use compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS (shapefile) or Google Earth (KML or KMZ).
