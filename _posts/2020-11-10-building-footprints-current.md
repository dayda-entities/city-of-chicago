Building footprints in Chicago. Metadata may be viewed and downloaded at http://bit.ly/HZVDIY. The data can be viewed on the Chicago Data Portal with a web browser. However, to view or use the files outside of a web browser, you will need to use compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS (shapefile) or Google Earth (KML or KMZ), is required.
