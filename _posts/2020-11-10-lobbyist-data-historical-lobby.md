The lobbyist compensation report is part of the Lobbyist Activity Report, a notarized disclosure that lobbyists were required to file twice during 2010 (January 20th and July 20th).
Lobbyists were required to report all lobbying related compensation received during each reporting period, rounded to the nearest $1,000 on Form C Part 3 Section G (http://bit.ly/q2lRTh).
In 2010, all lobbyist compensation reports are submitted to the Board of Ethics in paper form and are available in their entirety in the Board's offices.  Data for the 2010 reporting period is limited because previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings.
