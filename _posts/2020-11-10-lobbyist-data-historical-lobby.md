The lobbyist categorized expenditures report is part of the Lobbyist Activity Report, a notarized disclosure that lobbyists were required to file twice during 2010 (January 20th and July 20th). Lobbyists were required to report  the total amount of lobbying-related expenditures paid by the lobbyist or charged to the client in each of the categories listed on Form C, Part 3 of 3, Section H, Question 3 (http://bit.ly/q2lRTh). Data for the 2010 reporting period is limited because previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings. / Data Owner: Board of Ethics [http://j.mp/mbH9BN] / Time Period: 2010/ Frequency: Data is updated daily / Related Applications: Registered Lobbyist List http://j.mp/l8LwAq
