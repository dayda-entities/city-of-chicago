All lobbyist termination fillings submitted to the Board of Ethics and electronically transcribed by Board of Ethics employees during the 2010 reporting period. / 
When a lobbyist terminates all activity that requires registration, the lobbyist must file a termination notice and a final activity report that covers the period between the most recently filed activity report and the date of termination.
Data for the 2010 reporting period is limited because previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings. /  
Data Owner:  Board of Ethics
