The lobbyist agency report is part of the Lobbyist Activity Report, a notarized disclosure that lobbyists were required to file twice during 2010 (January 20th and July 20th).
Lobbyists were required to report the name of each City agency lobbied and report whether lobbying involved legislative or administrative action, and give a brief description of the legislative or administrative action promoted or opposed.
Data for the 2010 reporting period is limited because previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings. 
Data Owner:  Board of Ethics
