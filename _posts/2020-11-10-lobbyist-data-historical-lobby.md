The lobbyist gift report is part of the Lobbyist Activity Report, a notarized disclosure that lobbyista were required to file twice during 2010 (January 20th and July 20th).

Lobbyists were required to report every gift given to an official or employee of the City by the lobbyist during the reporting period.

Data for the 2010 reporting period is limited because previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings.
