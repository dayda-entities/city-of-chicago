Property Tax Abatement data includes all projects that have received a supporting City Council Ordinance since January, 2011. Cook County offers several property tax incentive programs that promote economic development and employment opportunities by reducing property taxes on qualifying properties for a fixed period. The Department of Planning and Development reviews applications for compliance with program eligibility requirements.
