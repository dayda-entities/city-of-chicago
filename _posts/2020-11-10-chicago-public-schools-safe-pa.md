Chicago Public Schools, in partnership with parents, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and City of Chicago, has expanded the District's successful Safe Passage Program to provide safe routes to and from school every day for your child. This map presents the Safe Passage Routes specifically designed for designated schools during the 2015-2016 school year. To view or use these shapefiles, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as Google Earth or ArcGIS, are required.
