This data is for materials pulled to fulfill patron holds. In April 2017 Chicago Public Library migrated to a new integrated library system and the Holds Filled data is now calculated differently. The Chicago Public Library consists of the Harold Washington Library Center, Sulzer and Woodson regional libraries and over 70 neighborhood branches. Many locations experience sporadic emergency closures due to heating or air conditioning issues, or area power outages. Independence Branch closed due to a fire on 10/30/15. Sulzer Regional Library was closed for three weeks in October/November 2016 for major facility repairs. Woodson Regional Library has been closed for major construction since November 2016, and is expected to reopen in late 2017.
