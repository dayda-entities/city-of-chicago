Clients represented by registered lobbyists as reported in their Lobbyist Statements  of Registration.  Due to requirements for lobbyists to re-register and the importance of showing year for most lobbying-related data, the same client often will have multiple records.  See http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/ethics/provdrs/lobby.html for more information on the Board of Ethics' role in regulating and reporting on lobbying in Chicago.
