Warming Centers offer residents warming refuge from oppressive winter cold. The Chicago Department of Family and Support Services operates six Warming 
Centers during the winter months. Additional facilities are opened as needed in libraries, Park District buildings, senior centers and other community venues. 
You may call 311 to locate a Warming Center in your area, or go to http://bit.ly/kIhHPj for more information.
