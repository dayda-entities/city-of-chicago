OUTDATED. See the current data at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/hz9b-7nh8 -- Building footprints in Chicago. The data can be viewed on the Chicago Data Portal with a web browser. However, to view or use the files outside of a web browser, you will need to use compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS (shapefile) or Google Earth (KML or KMZ), is required. Metadata may be viewed and downloaded at http://bit.ly/HZVDIY.
