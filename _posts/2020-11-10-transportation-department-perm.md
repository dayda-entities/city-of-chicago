Applications to the Chicago Department of Transportation for permits under its jurisdiction, which typically are permits to block or otherwise affect public streets in some way.  Because all permits start as applications, this dataset also serves as a list of permits granted.  See more information about CDOT permits at http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/construction_information/svcs/online-permit-portal.html.
