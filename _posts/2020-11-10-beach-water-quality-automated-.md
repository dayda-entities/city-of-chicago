The Chicago Park District maintains sensors in the water at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront. These sensors generally capture the indicated measurements hourly while the sensors are in operation during the summer.  During other seasons and at some other times, information from the sensors may not be available.  See https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75 for a dataset with land-based weather measurements at selected beaches.  The sensor locations are listed at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/g3ip-u8rb.

Please note that sensor locations change with the Park Districtâ€™s operational needs, primarily related to water quality. For more information on beach operations, please see https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/beaches.
